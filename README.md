## Reviews (Chrome Web Store Reviews)
 * I am a teacher and technology integration coach in my school district.  I also present at many conferences each year with EdTechTeam at the Google Summits.  I LOVE the Webpage Screenshot Chrome extension - especially the ability to edit content in the screenshot.  Teachers are so excited about this feature when I show it to them.
 
 * Thank you very much, it's Awesome. The best screenshot app!
